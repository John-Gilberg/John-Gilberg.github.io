    <p>Hello, my name is John Gilberg. I am a sophomore at Penn State University, majoring in Civil Engineering. I have have a strong interest in structural engineering and sustainable design. During the summer of 2024, I interned at PennDOT, where I gained hands-on experience surveying roadways, shoulders, guide rails, and drainage systems. I am eager to learn more about innovative engineering solutions and connect with professionals and companies in the field to explore potential internship opportunities.</p>
  <h2 class="centered">DIGIT 100 Projects</h2>
    <p>The following is my reflection to the "Data Brokers: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver" video after watching it on Youtube. "In the Data Brokers segment from Last Week Tonight with John Oliver viewers learned about the hidden ways data gets collected and its impact on personal privacy and identity. The extent of personal information data brokers collect and resell shocked me because they do this discreetly without our awareness or permission. The video showed that basic internet activities create detailed personal profiles without your knowledge. Data brokers collect detailed information which goes way beyond basic facts such as health, money, and personal beliefs. Our digital privacy slips away more each day as businesses gather personal information. The incomplete rules in U.S. regulations let these business methods thrive across different states. The European Union's GDPR offers better protection than U.S. law which allows data brokers to work without strict oversight. Our online privacy is at risk because no one knows for sure if users grant real permission or if companies disclose how they use personal data. This video elevated my interest in the data protection techniques and support regulations for this industry. The video showed users how to protect their data by controlling app permissions and using privacy-centric tools. Viewers were taught how important it is to protect our digital privacy through personal actions and new rules for data security." That is one of the first assignments I did in my DIGIT 100 class. More of my projects can be found by clicking the links in the navigation bar at the top of the page. As mentioned before, this website is currently under heavy construction, so please bear with me for the time being, as some of the links lead to blank pages for now.</p>
