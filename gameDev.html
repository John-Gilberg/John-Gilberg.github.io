      <p>"Fork in the Road" is an interactive Twine game created to explore the emotional, academic, and social stress placed on high school seniors when they have life-changing choices. I designed this game because I've seen how overwhelming this final year can be; students have to make gargantuan choices about their lives while juggling grades, relationships, and mental health. I was looking to design something that expressed that sense of uncertainty in a way that was real, yet intimate, and let people see how smaller choices can have entirely different kinds of outcomes.</p>
      <p>While developing it, I came to realize how challenging it is to produce branching narratives that stay emotionally intact yet give people actual agency. Twine gave me the means to build a web of choice supported by variables like stress, motivation, and support, and I used over 10 different Harlowe macros to control how the story reacts to player inputs. I understood how structure and coding for the story are closely related; writing each scene wasn't a matter of what happens next, but what that scene represents in the bigger picture.</p>
      <p>The most satisfying was seeing the narrative live in a way that was more than pages on a screen; it became a living thing where characters could relate to their fears, hopes, and doubts. Moments like "Midnight Panic" or "Compromise Talk" allowed me to illustrate the emotional richness of these choices, and I liked crafting many endings that reflected alternate but real possibilities, from college to burnout. Watching how each decision affected the player's journey made me feel like I was a part of something and that I had a stake in the characters I created.</p>
      <p>All that said, though, there wasn't always an easy process. Twine logic bugs, variable glitches, and tangled link paths were always a challenge. Sometimes the emotional tone of a passage clashed with the speed of the story, or a choice tree grew too complex to handle neatly. Balancing realism and playability was a difficult tightrope to tightwire. I did not want the stakes to be too low, but also not to weigh the player down. Balancing burnout in the character and myself was a process.</p>
      <p>If I were to go back and redo this project at some point, I would like to add visual and sound layers to make it more immersive, and more personalization elements like character names or identity questions. I’d also refine the writing in certain sections to better match the emotional tone and offer more mid-path feedback, helping players understand how their decisions shape the outcome. Fork in the Road taught me how powerful interactive fiction can be, and I’m proud to have built a game that encourages empathy, reflection, and difficult but meaningful choices.</p>
