      <h2>Reading Grimm Brothers' Fairy Tales through Text Encoding and Voyant</h2>

      <p>Grimm Brothers' fairy tales like Hansel and Gretel, Little Red-Cap, Rapunzel, and Snowdrop are best sellers owing to rich characterization, engaging plots, and latent moral lessons inherent in them. In this essay, I will illustrate how encoding the stories with XML markup and analyzing them with the Voyant tool helped me comprehend their structure, themes, and interpersonal relationships between characters in a deeper manner. With the application of these two analysis techniques, I was able to discover substantial patterns and meanings that further our knowledge of these classic fables.</p>
      <p>First, encoding the fairy tales in XML allowed me to organize and structure the texts in a way such that their fundamental elements became easier to analyze. Using XML tags such as title, paragraph (p), and dialog made it easier for me to break the stories into various elements, making it easier to divide and examine important factors such as the characters' dialogue and key themes. For example, in Hansel and Gretel, I used the tag dialog for the characters' dialogue so that I could easily separate the characters' dialogue from the story's narrative. This enabled me to concentrate on how dialogue helps to build plot and characters. The following is an example of how dialog helps build the stepmothers character: <code>When day dawned, but before the sun had risen, the &ltcharacter name="Stepmother" role="villain"&gtwoman&lt/character&gt came and awoke the two children, saying: &ltdialog&gt‘Get up, you &ltdefine&gtsluggards&lt/define&gt! we are going into the forest to fetch wood.’&lt/dialog&gt She gave each a little piece of bread, and said: &ltdialog&gt‘There is something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then, for you will get nothing else.’&lt/dialog&gt</code>.</p>
      <p>Additionally, using the character tag enabled me to label key characters in both stories, with an intensive description of their roles and relationships. In Little Red-Cap, for instance, I used the character tag to establish contrast between Little Red-Cap and the wolf. By doing that, I was able to show the difference between the two characters, and the same applies to the story's prominent themes such as trust, deception, and danger. Here is an example of the XML enconded text that shows the differentiation of characters: <code>&ltp&gtThe &ltcharacter name="Grandmother" role="supporting"&gtgrandmother&lt/character&gt lived out in the wood, half a &ltdefine&gtleague&lt/define&gt from the village, and just as &ltcharacter name="Little Red-Cap" role="protagonist"&gtLittle Red-Cap&lt/character&gt entered the wood, a &ltcharacter name="Wolf" role="antagonist"&gtwolf&lt/character&gt met her. Red-Cap did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of him.&lt/p&gt</code> Similarly, in Rapunzel, I marked the central character with the character tag so that I could trace her development over the course of the story, particularly her journey to becoming free after being held captive from birth as the following XML snippet shows. <code>The &ltcharacter name="The Man" role="husband"&gtman&lt/character&gt in his terror consented to everything, and when the &ltcharacter name="The Woman" role="wife"&gtwoman&lt/character&gt was brought to bed, the &ltcharacter name="The Enchantress (Dame Gothel)" role="antagonist"&gtenchantress&lt/character&gt appeared at once, gave the child the name of &ltcharacter name="Rapunzel" role="protagonist"&gtRapunzel&lt/character&gt, and took it away with her.</code></p>
      <p>Another important aspect of my encoding was using the theme tag in a bid to recognize frequent motifs in the tales. Survival is a frequent motif in Hansel and Gretel, for example, where the children must outwit the witch in a struggle to live. The main theme from Hansel and Gretel is <code>&lttheme&gtSurvival and Resilience&lt/theme&gt.</code> Through the use of these tags, it was also easier for me to monitor the way the theme progresses throughout the story. For Snowdrop, jealousy and envy are the paramount themes, and the theme tag helped me monitor closely how the story deals with such themes, i.e., through the way the character interacts with the evil queen. By the end of the story, it was clear that the key message was as follows: <code>&lttheme&gtJealousy and Envy&lt/theme&gt</code>, specifically how nothing good comes from acting on those feelings.</p>
      <p>The application of the define and slang tags was also useful concerning the enjoyment of the role of language within the overall story meanings. With the application of the define tag for obscure words or antique terms, I could set them up for comprehension among present-day readers who possibly didn't quite recognize them as commonly as may be the case in this modern era. For instance, I used the define tag in Hansel and Gretel to define the word "dearth" so the readers would have a better understanding of the social environment of the time. <code>He had little to bite and to break, and once when great &ltdefine&gtdearth&lt/define&gt fell on the land, he could no longer procure even daily bread.</code> I have also tagged colloquialisms with the slang tag so that historical flavor in the stories is preserved at the same time as making modern-day readers more aware. <code>&ltdialog&gt‘&ltslang&gtThou&lt/slang&gt, queen, &ltslang&gtart&lt/slang&gt the fairest in all the land.’&lt/dialog&gt</code></p>
      <p>Having previously coded the texts myself, I then utilized Voyant's tools in order to examine the texts more quantitatively, in a broader scope. Voyant's array of visualization tools, from word clouds and frequency graphs to trend lines, allowed me to discern patterns in the texts that perhaps would have passed less easily without the use of manual reading alone. For example, throughout the various fairy tales, the word "said" was determined to have the highest frequency by far by the word cloud, which indicates the emphasis on dialog being the main way to create character interaction and reveal character traits to the reader. In addition, words like "came" and "went" that were used most frequently after "said" show the progressiveness and the constant chugging along of the fariy tales. The image below is a representation of the 100 most common words used in the corpus.</P> <iframe style='width: 491px; height: 370px;' src='https://voyant-tools.org/tool/Cirrus/?visible=100&corpus=7e075398fc0af7112deed6a02050b798'></iframe>
      <p>Voyant's tools also enabled me to see the usage of keywords throughout the entire text and see how the word choice varied throughout. This made it easy to monitor trends that pointed out the most important points of the stories. The following chart shows the frequency of the most common words used throughout the entire text. The word "said" is excluded because it is the most common word used in every fairy tale.</p><iframe style='width: 491px; height: 369px;' src='https://voyant-tools.org/tool/Trends/?query=little&query=away&query=king&query=took&query=man&query=good&query=time&query=went&query=came&mode=document&corpus=7e075398fc0af7112deed6a02050b798'></iframe>
      <p>Voyant, together with XML encoding, provided me with double perspectives on the Grimm Brothers' fairy tales. XML allowed me to break down the stories into manageable, structured pieces such as characters, themes, and dialogue while Voyant provided me with a broader, quantitative picture of the language and patterns of the tales. Together, the two methods helped me to have a better idea of the main themes of each tale. For instance, Voyant and XML analysis of Hansel and Gretel both detected the survival theme running underneath the story. Similarly, the problem of trust and dishonesty was discovered to be underlying in Little Red-Cap both through encoded words and word density depicting this problem in Voyant's cloud of words.</p>
      <p>Employing both Voyant and XML tags, I found that I could uncover a richer insight into the manner in which the Grimm Brothers' fairy tales communicate their moral lessons. The XML encoding provided me with a concise, formal means of analyzing the characters, dialogue, and themes, while Voyant's visualizations allowed me to see the broader patterns in the language and structure. Quantitative and qualitative analysis together served to illuminate greater connections between the texts and provide a more detailed interpretation of the tales. By presenting the texts in XML and reading them through Voyant, I also realized how recurring motifs were used and how they support the universal lessons of the tales. This two-stage process not only deepened my appreciation for the stories but also attested to the strength of digital tools for modern literary analysis.</p>
